This Spring Boot project shows how to test a REST controller using @WebMvcTest.
- It mocks the BookService to isolate controller logic.
- Tests for 200 OK and 404 Not Found are written using MockMvc.
- The controller returns a Book or throws a custom BookNotFoundException.
- Spring REST Docs can be added to document the endpoints further.
